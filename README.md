# Invaders
Invaders (I really need a better name) is a shoot-'em-up game inspired
by Space Invaders (well, obviously), Galaga and a number of other games.

But there is a twist - everything is procedurally generated. Not only
ship sprites, but also weapons, enemy ship formations and attack patterns.
Players will have to learn and adapt to this in each playthrough, in
almost a roguelike fashion.

## Current state
Game is playable, but lacks content - promised generated
formations/patterns. Anyway, you can score points by killing same enemy
formation over and over again.

## Roadmap
* support mobile devices
* add content for minimal interesting-to-play version
* think of a better name
* content for level generator
* intro sequence
* optimize for N3DS browser and maybe some other unusual platforms
* add an ability to record gameplay as gifs/video
* add social media buttons for easier highscore boasting
